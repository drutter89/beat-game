The idea for the game is an animation will play with a line moving. Your goal is to press a designated key once the line hits the end of its path. 

If you time this correctly, your score will increment by 1. The game will time down from a certain designated time. Ultimate the goal will be to have the line animation move at a random pace. But for now it will run at a smooth pace to get everything set up.
